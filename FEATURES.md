# Feature Roadmap

Candidate features to make Schema Breeze useful to SEOs and developers beyond personal use. Ordered by priority. Current state: v0.2.0 (v0.1.1 signed unlisted on AMO) (see README for what exists today).

**Done:** full vocabulary validation (1.1), the page-content mismatch check (1.3) and block provenance (2.3). See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-02-vocab-and-mismatch-validation-design.md`. **Next:** rich-result eligibility verdicts (1.2).

## 1. Trustworthy validation

### 1.1 Full schema.org vocabulary validation — DONE
- Bundle the schema.org vocabulary (`schemaorg-current-https.jsonld`, about 1 MB; bundling is fine and AMO forbids remote code anyway). Preprocess it at build time into a compact map of types → allowed properties (including inherited ones) and properties → expected value types.
- Flag unknown types, unknown or misspelled properties with "did you mean" suggestions (`adress` → `address`, via edit distance), and values whose type doesn't match the property's range.
- Where it plugs in: `src/lib/validate.ts`. The existing `PARENT` subtype map could come from the vocabulary instead of being maintained by hand.
- Afterwards, update the "Limits" section of the README.

### 1.2 Rich-result eligibility verdict per entity
- For example: "Product: eligible for merchant listing" or "Missing `offers` → not eligible".
- Builds on the existing `RULES` in `validate.ts` (about 25 types). Split each type's rules into required and recommended, and show a verdict badge in `EntityDetail` and the Issues view.

### 1.3 Markup vs. visible-content mismatch — DONE
- Flag schema values that don't appear in the page's visible text: `price`, `ratingValue`, `reviewCount`, `name`, `headline`, `author` name, and so on. Google treats this mismatch as a spam signal.
- Implementation: in `public/extract.js`, also return the page's normalized visible text (`document.body.innerText`, or a trimmed or hashed version). Compare with normalization: strip whitespace and case, and accept number formats like `19.99` vs. `$19.99` vs. `19,99`.
- Severity: a warning rather than an error, since some values legitimately aren't visible (`sku`, `gtin`, ISO dates).

## 2. Lean into the graph (the differentiator)

### 2.1 Graph coverage hints
- Disconnected subgraphs, duplicate entities across them and missing standard links (`isPartOf`, `breadcrumb`, `mainEntity`, `publisher`, `author`) are done in `src/lib/islands.ts`.
- Still to do: "Organization has no `logo`", "Article `author` isn't a Person entity", and similar hints about entities that are connected but thin.

### 2.2 Compare two pages or versions
- Diff the entity graph of the current scan against the previous scan of the same URL, or against another URL (staging vs. production). Show added, removed and changed entities and properties.
- Storing previous scans requires adding the `storage` permission to the manifest.

### 2.3 Block provenance — DONE
- Label each JSON-LD block by the plugin or app that wrote it, tell server-rendered blocks from JavaScript-injected ones, and flag blocks that compete to define the same entity.
- **Later, optional:** a document_start MAIN-world script that records stack traces for DOM insertions, to name the exact injecting script (e.g. gtm.js). Costs: runs on every page, needs a reload to capture, more AMO review.

## 3. Fix, don't just report

### 3.1 Quick-fix snippets
- For each issue, show a corrected JSON-LD fragment with a copy button (for example, with the missing `priceCurrency` added or the date converted to ISO 8601).

### 3.2 Edit and re-test in place
- An editable JSON-LD pane in the sidebar that re-validates as you type. Optionally, inject the edited block into the page to preview it.

## 4. Agency workflow

### 4.1 Client-ready report export
- HTML (and/or printable PDF) containing the page URL, eligibility verdicts, issues by severity, a PNG of the graph (PNG export already exists) and the raw JSON-LD.

### 4.2 Batch scan
- Crawl the first N internal links (or URLs from `sitemap.xml`) and show a summary table of which pages or templates are missing which schema and which issues repeat across them.

## 5. Reach

- **List publicly on AMO** instead of unlisted. Needs listing copy, screenshots and a demo GIF that leads with the graph view.
- **Chrome Web Store listing.** The Chrome build exists (`npm run build:chrome`); publishing needs a developer account, store screenshots and a privacy disclosure.
- Remember to bump `version` in `package.json` (the manifests take it from there) before each store submission (AMO rejects duplicate versions).
